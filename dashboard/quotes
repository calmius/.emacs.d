Anxiety caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action
The hurrier I go, the behinder I get
Rule your mind or it will rule you
The beginning is half of every action
Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time, THEY get stuck because the doing of them has not been defined
Be grateful in spite of your suffering
Do not do things that you hate
Do not hide things in the fog
Be careful who you share good news with
Be careful who you share bad news with
Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that
Treat yourself as if you were someone that you are responsible for helping
Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
Dress like the person you want to be
Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street
Don't let bullies get away with it
Mindless consumption is not productivity.
Finished beats Perfect
